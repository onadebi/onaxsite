Connecting a Django application to Azure Cosmos DB using the Core (SQL) API involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Install the necessary packages**: You'll need to install the `pydocumentdb` package, which is the Python SDK for Azure Cosmos DB SQL API.

2. **Create a Cosmos DB account**: Set up your Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal and obtain your URI and primary key for authentication.

3. **Configure your Django settings**: In your Django project's settings file, you'll need to configure the database settings to use the Cosmos DB credentials.

4. **Define your models**: Since Cosmos DB is a NoSQL database, you'll define your models a bit differently than you would for a relational database.

5. **Run migrations**: Run Django migrations to set up your database schema in Cosmos DB.

6. **Perform database operations**: Use Django's ORM to perform CRUD operations, which will interact with Cosmos DB.

Here's a sample configuration for your Django settings:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.cosmos',
        'NAME': 'your_cosmos_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_cosmos_db_account_uri',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_cosmos_db_account_key',
        'HOST': 'your_cosmos_db_account_uri',
        'PORT': '443',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'ssl': True,
            'session_token': 'your_cosmos_db_session_token'
        },
    }
}
```

Please note that you might need to use a custom database backend or adjust the settings according to the specific requirements of your project and the version of Cosmos DB you are using.

For detailed instructions and code examples, you can refer to the official Azure documentation or look for community-contributed packages or tutorials that provide Django support for Cosmos DB.
