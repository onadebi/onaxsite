Cloning a Git repository into a non-empty directory can be a bit tricky because the `git clone` command doesn't allow it directly. However, there are workarounds to achieve this. Here's a method you can use:

1. Navigate to the non-empty directory where you want to clone the repository.
2. Initialize a new Git repository with the command:
   ```
   git init
   ```
3. Add the remote repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin PATH/TO/REPO
   ```
4. Fetch the contents of the remote repository:
   ```
   git fetch
   ```
5. Reset the local metadata to reflect the remote repository:
   ```
   git reset origin/master
   ```
   (Replace `master` with the branch you want to track if it's not `master`.)
6. Check out the files:
   ```
   git checkout -t origin/master
   ```
   (The `-t` flag will set the upstream branch, which is usually what you want.)

7. Restore the files:
   ```
   git restore .

This process will preserve the existing files in your directory and overlay the repository's content. Remember to replace `PATH/TO/REPO` with the actual URL or path to your Git repositoryÂ¹.
